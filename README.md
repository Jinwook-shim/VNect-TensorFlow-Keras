# VNect-TensorFlow-Keras

This is an implementation of a VNect model with TF-Keras referring to **"VNect: Real-time 3D Human Pose Estimation with a Single RGB Camera"** paper in SIGGRAPH`17.  [[website](http://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/VNect/)]

The network structure of VNect is shown in the figure above.
The graph of the network model based on this structure is shown in the [link](./model.png).
